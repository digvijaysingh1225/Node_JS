We have to add dynamic data - for this we have to use template engines.

EJS, Pub, Handlebars

hbs -  Express.js view engine for handlebars.js
npm install hbs

first we have to create a folder named views in which we have to store the html file.
For the use of template engines page we have to set view engines

for dynamic changes we have to use '{{writename}}' in place where we have to see dynamic changes and write any name in between them.
And we have to initialize writename in the app.js where you are rendering the page.

Basically, we have to create a views directory for the template engine of name views only.
But we can change the name of the directory by doing some changes i.e. 
set a templatePath as the path of the directory with changed name and the set the path by using app.set("view", templatePath);
