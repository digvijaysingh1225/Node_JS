            Node.js Streams

Streams: are objects that let yoyu read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion. In Node.js, there are fopur types of streams-
Streaming means listening to music or watching video in 'real time', instead of downloading a file to your computer and watching it later

Readable - Stream which is used for read operation.
Writable - Stream which is used for write operation.
Duplex - Stream which can be used for both read and write operation.
Transform - A type of duplex stram where the output is computer based on input.

Each type of Stream is an EventEmitter instance and throws several events at different instance of times. For example, some of the commonly used events are - 

data - This event is fired when there is data is available to read.
end -  This event is fired when there is no more data to read.
error - This event is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data.
finish - This event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system. 


stream.pipe() -  The method used to take a readable stream and connect it to a writable stream.

readable.pipe(destination[, options])
Finally done
